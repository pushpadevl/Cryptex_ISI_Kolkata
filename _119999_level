	Communication was crucial during the world war for countries involved.
	Here we have a slightly twisted version of one of those machines. You can
	use the `cipher15` command to run the encryption machine to see how it encrypts.
	The machine consisted of : a typewriter/keyboard, a plugboard, four stepping
	switches. 
	Note:	a) Use the `cipher15` command to run the machine.
		c) The encryption machine has four stepping switches S, L, M, R each one 
			having 25 unrelated permutations.
		d) The S stepping switch has 25 permutations of six characters, whereas 
			the L, M, R switches each have 25 permutations of 20 characters.
		e) For eg. say S with 2 permutation of 6 characters can be viewed as 
			3 6 1 5 4 2
			4 2 3 1 5 6  
		f) Everytime a character is enciphered, the switches position change but 
			only after the character is enciphered.
		g) The machine starts from a fixed setting of S, L, M, R. For example 
			S=21, L=2, M=14, R=5, but as a character is enciphered the values
			of switches change.
		h) S steps with every character enciphered, while the L, M, R step with 
			some logic, although only one of L, M, R moves at a time.
			S=21, L=2, M=14, R=5 changes to
			S=22, L=3, M=14, R=5 which then changes to
			S=23, L=3, M=15, R=5 which then changes to
			S=24, L=3, M=15, R=6.
			The stepping logic is not the same as the machine's stepping logic.
			
	The flow of encryption is as follows:
		1) P -> C1 | A character typed on keyboard is permuted using the plugboard. 
		2) Depending on whether it is one of the sixes or twenties, it is permuted
			as follows: 
			i) C1 -> C1S = C2 | Sixes permute using the switch S only.
		       ii) C1T -> C1L -> C1M -> C1R = C2 | Twenties permute using the L, M, R 
				switches in order.
		3) In either case, S moves one step while only one of L, M, R moves at a
			time.
		4) C2 -> C3 | The permuted character is now reverse permuted using the same plugboard
			using in Step 1.
		5) C3 is the final ciphertext character.
