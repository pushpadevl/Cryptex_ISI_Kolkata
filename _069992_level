Level 6

	A mathematician was murdered and Sherlock Holmes found a 
	text-"bmfdavj.roq@keh#fwnkvtbocmy" written on a pad by him. Sherlock 
	deduced that the digit might refer to the password to his device 
	where he saved his secret research papers. But it wasn't. He also 
	found a matrix drawn on some pages of the pad, 
	0	3	5
	5	5	2
	3	4	3

	He also noticed a line under the matrix-
	"foxh wr rewdlq wkh sdvvzrug iru wkhvdih: xvh wkh kloo flskhu zlwk 
	lqwhjhu prgxor wzhqwb vla."

	He tried to guess the sentence, but unable to do that. Being a good 
	friend of Sherlock your name came into his mind. He sent all the 
	informations to you. Now you immediately found that the above line 
	may be obtained using Caesar cipher. Now decrypt the whole message 
	and help Sherlock.
