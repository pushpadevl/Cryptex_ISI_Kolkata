Level 12

 
	    
	There is a street with houses numbered sequentially from 1. It is known 
	that the number of houses is more than 10,000 and less than 60,000. My 
	friend is living in a house somewhere in the middle such that if you add 
	the numbers before and after that house the sums are equal. 

	Encryption Scheme: Suppose 45132 is the keyword then,

	4 5 1  3  2	             1 2  3  4  5
	a b c  d  e                  c e  d  a  b
	f g h i/j k                  h k i/j f  g
	l m n  o  p                  n p  o  l  m
	q r s  t  u                  s u  t  q  r
	v w x  y  z                  x z  y  v  w

	So, cryptex will be encrypted to duvmqby.

	Your keyword is the no. of houses in the above problem. Now your password for
	 the next Level is "TKAJYUFCVNIZHLRIPIBIDEXGOCWSMQ"
